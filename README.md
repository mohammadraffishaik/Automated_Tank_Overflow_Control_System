# Automated_Tank_Overflow_Control_System
Automated Tank over flow control system using ULTRASONIC SENSOR and NODE MCU is a very helpful project to prevent water wastage. The ULTRASONIC SENSOR is used to measure the water level in terms of distance. this project is used to control the water level in the tank using NODE MCU by turning ON and OFF the water pump.
